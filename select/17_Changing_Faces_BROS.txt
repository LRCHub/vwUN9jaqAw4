I say faces are changing, faces are gathering
The good times brought people to my door
I need an outstretched, open hand, with a little understanding
To pick me up and dust me from this floor
People from the good times that was easy
But people from the bad times i thank you cos

(Chorus)
Changes make faces come and go
Got a look in your eyes it's the only way I know
Changes make faces come and go
Eyes on you face are the windows to your soul
(To your soul)

On body there's a footprint
In my mind an imprint
In your eyes just a little glint of guilt
I've taken the ride I've paid the fare
Now stop me if you, stop me if you dare
People from the good times that was easy
But people from the bad times i thank you (cos)

(Chorus)
Changes make faces come and go
Got a look in your eyes it's the only way I know
Changes make faces come and go
Eyes on your face are the windows to your soul
(To your soul)

But people from the bad times I thank you

(Chorus)
Changes make faces come and go
Got a look in your eyes it's the only way I know
Changes make faces come and go
Eyes on your face are the windows to your soul
(To your soul
