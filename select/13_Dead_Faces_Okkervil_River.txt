And we have fun, we go laughing and running
Down to the water, there by the sea
Where the body just floats like a rowboat
And the moon's like a harbor light lit in the sky

And this picture's got a woman who looks like you
And a guy who looks just like someone I've seen
When it turns out, I hope that it turns out
I hope that it turns out the way that you dreamed

Embarcadero train station's empty
And I just cannot believe how long it takes
All the way home through the city
And everyone's looking, at least,
It's nice to believe that everyone's looking

And this picture's got a woman who looks like you
And a guy who looks just like someone I've seen
When it turns out, I hope that it turns out
I hope that it turns out the way that you dreamed

Ghostly faces at my living-room window
They are not scared of me because they know I can't hurt them
They press up and see, in the lamp-glow
All of the hurt and the love inside of me

It's their final duty to see right through me
I tell them "twelve hours until the dawn, but we've got to hold on
Hold on to me, because we'll be running

Down to the water this morning
Well, nobody waits for you to believe
In ghosts, lit by moonlight or dawning
Or in this picture of you and me
